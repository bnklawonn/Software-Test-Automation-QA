How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

Ensuring functionality and security in my code begins with thorough testing. In these projects, I employed several types of testing that cover a wide range of scenarios. For example, in both the 'Contact' and 'Appointment' classes, I implemented validation checks for cricial fields like IDs, dates, and phone numbers to ensure that they met specific criteria. This approach allowed me to catch potential issues early, making the code more robust. Security is also a very important issue. I considered security by preventing null values and enforcing strict length constraints, which can prevent vulnerabilities or unexpected behaviors. Adopting a disciplined approach to testing ensures that the software is reliable and resistant to common errors. Regularly reviewing the code for potential weknesesses and implementing best practices helps in building secure software. 

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

Interpreting user needs starts with a deep understanding of the requirements, which are often communicated through specifications, research, or user stories. In these projects I paid attention to the requirements, such as adhereing to certain constraints, like length of IDs and descriptions. By aligning my code with specifications that were given, I ensured that my software met the users' expectations. Additionaly, my testing strategy was directly aligned with user needs. Tests were written to validate that only valid inputs were accepted, reflecting the expectation that users would not input data that could break the system. This process of iterative testing and refining the code ensured user needs were at the forefront. 

How do I approach designing software?

My approach to software design is systematic and iterative, as well as thourough and thoughtful. I began by breaking down the problem into managable components like 'Contact', 'Appointment', 'Task', and their service layers. This modular approach allowed me to focus on one piece of functionality at a time, ensuring that each part works correctly before integrating them. Once I had the basic structure down, I began focusing on edge cases and potential failures. In considering how the software could break, it allowed me to design the software to be more resilient. Throughout the design process I always kept the users perspective in mind, ensuring that the software is not only functional but also aligned with the users requests and needs. This user-centric approach in combination with rigourous testing and careful design, helped me to create software that is both effective and reliable.
